                This is where I record all of the websites I create. Each one of them is 
                recorded below with a brief title, an image of its homepage, and a short 
                description. The image of each site is a link to that site.

                This is a quick little travel site I made. I doesn't serve much of a purpose;
                it was the first site I made and it was mainly created to test my abilities.
                The subject of it is traveling to South America, and in the site, I discuss 
                places to visit, travel tips, things to do, and a (fake) contact us section.

                This site is what you're looking at right now. This site is a portfolio/
                progress site, which is for my own personal use. It records two things: 
                the coding I've learned, and the programs I've created. Whenever I learn 
                a new piece of information about a coding language, I intend to record it 
                on this site. Whenever I create a new website/script/other program, I also 
                record it on this site. <span class="showcaseDescriptionImportant">
                This site is a work in progress, is multi-page, and is slightly 
                responsive.</span>
